## So Far: ##

1 - Pandas Validation Set up, theres an internal and paramaterized path towards validating dtypes, column ranges, that kind of thing.

2 - TODO informs the set up that would go forward, doesn't take into account reparameterization on account of Airflow DAG distribution.

3 - ML Model pulled from corollary project, would be very simple to retrofit and use. Didn't pull the trigger on this because of the data not fitting.

4 - API Testing - Security Protocol Would be on the backend. API Securitys on Loydverse are as follows:

5 - Airflow Testing/Prod Environments - Industry Standard is Astronomer, this is what you'd want.
